/* ------------------ EXECUTE METHODS -----------------------
 *
 * Each of these methods takes a pointer to the "input" pipeline register,
 * and also (except for WB) to the "output" pipeline register.  Read
 * values from the input, and set the proper bits in the output.
 *
 * Several of the phases also take pointers to *OTHER* phases.  This allows
 * you to read the current state of other pipeline registers, so that you
 * can do (for instance) data forwarding and LW stalling.
 *
 * A couple of phases (ID, WB) also take a pointer to the array of registers.
 * This is a 34 (not 32!) element array: the last two are 'lo' and 'hi'.  If
 * you choose to implement the 'mult' or 'div' instructions, use these two
 * registers.  Otherwise, they should never change.
 *
 * MEM, of course, gets a pointer to the array of data words.
 *
 * The testcases will implement the IF phase for you.
 */



/* in the ID phase, you have a return value: return 0 to indicate "OK" and
 * 1 to indicate "ERROR".  (This is the equivalent of the 'err' field from
 * Project 9.)
 *
 * The rest of the phases have no ability to report an error; they simply
 * must do their work.
